<h1>How are reviews allocated</h1>
<p>Reviews are allocated automatically by the system using a backwards-allocation method.</p>

<p>Initial submissions are pooled and early submitters are told they will be notified by email when they can commence reviewing.</p>
<p>When the initial pool reaches the required size (around 4 to 5), each early submitter is allocated two reviews from the initial pool.</p>
<p>Later submitters review the submissions of two students who submitted before them (but not immediately before them). In this way, most students can review immediately after they submit.</p>
<p>The chain of review relationships can continue indefinitely after this point in time.</p>
<p>Here are some facts about the number of reviews students will conduct and receive.</p>
<ul>
    <li>All students are expected to complete two reviews (usually with the incentive of marks).</li>
    <li>Most students receive two peer reviews.</li>
    <li>Students in the initial pool may receive more than two peer reviews.</li>
    <li>Students at the tail-end of the reviewing chain will receive one or zero reviews, and these must be supplemented by the teacher.</li>
