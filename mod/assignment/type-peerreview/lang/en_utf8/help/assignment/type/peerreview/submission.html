<h1>Submission Column</h1>
<p>The Submission column shows the following.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>File Icon</strong><br />
    Click on the file icon to download or view the student's submission. The icon will differ according to the file type used.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Submission Date and Time</strong><br />
    When the submission was made. Reviews made by the student do not affect this submission date/time.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Resubmit Link</strong><br />
    Students can only submit once. If they submit the wrong file, a teacher can submit the correct file for them. Resubmitting removes the original submission and replaces it with a new file. Resubmitting does not change any other details about the student's submission, or their reviews, or reviews they have received. If resubmission is done after reviews have been made, the teacher may have to complete a moderation review as peer reviews of this student will be based on their original submission. Be wary when resubmitting  a student's submission after they have completed reviews. If they have, they will have seen other student's submissions. Make a policy to accept resubmissions only if the student has not completed reviews, unless you implicitly trust the student.</li>
</ul>
