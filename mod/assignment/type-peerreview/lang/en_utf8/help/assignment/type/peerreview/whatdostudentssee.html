<h1>What do students see when reviewing?</h1>
<p>Students see a single, unfilled column of check boxes, the criteria and a single text area for entering comments.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better question is: "what don't students see?"</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Students don't see other students' names or submission details</strong><br />
    In the student view, all student details are anonymised.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Students don't see other student reviews</strong><br />
    Students do not see the peer reviews of the current submission that were conducted by other students before them. These are show to teachers as a useful guide when reviewing, and also as a way of keeping an eye on students' review correctness.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Students don't have a list of pre-saved comments</strong><br />
    Students do not have the luxury of using pre-saved comments. Writing original comments is part of their evaluation task. For teachers, the pre-saved comments are useful for quick and consistent moderation; they are particularly useful when multiple teachers are marking.</li>
</ul>
