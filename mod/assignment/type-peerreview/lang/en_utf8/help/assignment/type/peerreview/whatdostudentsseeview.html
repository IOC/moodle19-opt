<h1>What do students see on the Description page?</h1>
<p>Initially a student sees much the same as a teacher sees on the Description page, including the description and the criteria. Students don't have tabs at the top of the page and cannot edit criteria. Students do have a guide to what stage they are up to in the reviewing process, and a submission facility at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>After student's submit, they are taken through the stages of reviewing.</p>
<p>When a student has completed reviews, they are shown an overview page which displays:</p>
<ul>
    <li>details of their submission and marks;</li>
    <li>information about the quality of reviews they have completed; and</li>
    <li>feedback from their peers and teachers (review criteria and comments).</li>
</ul>
<p>At all stages, students can see the description. It is sometimes compacted for space, but it is always available to them.</p>
